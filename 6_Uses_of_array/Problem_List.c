📌️📌️CHAPTER:- 6. USES OF ARRAY:------


      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 44: Take an array of integer data type of size 10. Get input from user and store the values in the array and finally 
        print the sum of those 10 integers.


      
      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 45: Say you are given the following array of integer data type- [-99,45,100,37,89,-327,245]. Now write a program which 
        will find the biggest integer and print the integer with its index.


      
      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 46: Get your name from keyboard and print it with greeting like-

                        Hello Mr. “Your name”.

                        Print without quote and get your name in one word..


      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 47: Take an array of integer data type of size 5. Scan the values from the user. Now print the average of integers 
       which are greater than 100.


      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 48: Take an array of integer data type of size 5. Scan the values from the user. Now print the output like the 
       following one-

                              Values in array: 10 25 20 15 30

                              Sum of odd values: 40

                              Sum of even values: 60


      
      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 49: Take a two dimensional array of integer data type of size [3 * 3]. Take the values from the user using scanf(). 
       Now print the average of all the values.


      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 50: Take a two dimensional array of integer data type of size [3 * 3]. Take the values from the user using scanf(). 
        Now print the summation of the values of diagonal elements like the following one [1 + 5 + 9 = 15]-

                                         1 2 3

                                         4 5 6

                                         7 8 9


      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 51: Take three arrays [A, B and AB] of float data type of size 5. Scan the values of two arrays [A and B] from user. 
        Now assign the summation of the two arrays to the AB. (AB[i] = A[i] + B[i]).

                                 Finally, print the values of AB array.


      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 52: Take two arrays [A and B] of float data type of size 5. Scan the values of two arrays from user. 
      Now compare the averages of two arrays and print the largest average with the array name.

                            Output format: [Avg: 55.55 -> A]


      
      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 53: You are given the following array of integers-

                 [1, 23, 10, 15, 17, 21, 44, 43, 53].

                 Now write a program which will print the prime numbers with its index.
