        Problem 91: Write a program which takes an integer as input and print ‚ÄúYES, Prime‚Äù if the number is prime otherwise ‚ÄúNO‚Äù.


        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Problem 92: Write a program which takes the coordinates of two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) from the user and print the distance
         of those two points.


        
        
        
        
        
        
        Problem 93: Write a program which will take the length of three sides of a triangle and print the measures of the three angles.


        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Problem 94: Read two numbers A and B from user. Calculate and print the sum of their factorials. Be careful, because the resulT
         may have more than 15 digits.


        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Problem 95: A dog eats just half of its supply of food in one day. Write a program that scans the initial capacity of the food
         supply (in Kg), and calculate how many days will pass before the dog eat all the supply food until left 1 Kg or less.


        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Problem 96: Take a decimal number as input and print the binary version of that number.


        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Problem 97: Write a program which will find the greatest common divisor of two numbers. If user gives input 5 and 30, your output
         should be 5.


        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Problem 98: Take two numbers of 20 digits and print the sum of those two numbers.


        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Problem 99: Write a program to calculate the nearest integer number of the square root value of a number. User will give the
         number as input. Your program will find the square root value of that number and print the nearest integer of that value.


                      Problem 100: Find the largest prime number between 100000 to 500000
