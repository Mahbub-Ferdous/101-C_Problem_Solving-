       character of it. All the alphabets of the input string will be small letter. [If user gives input ‚Äúabc‚Äù you should print ‚Äúdef‚Äù, if

                   eLepHanT Elephant

       not a palindrome. Now write a program which will take a string as input from the user and print ‚ÄúYES, It is a palindrome‚Äù if it
        satisfies the condition otherwise print ‚ÄúNo, It is not a palindrome‚Äù.


      Problem 73: Let‚Äôs take a string and you have to find how many alphabets are there and their repetitions. Case sensitive.
