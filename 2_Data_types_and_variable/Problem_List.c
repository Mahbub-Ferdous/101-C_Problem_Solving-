      Problem 6: Take three integer variables a, b and c. Assign values to the variables- a = 10, b = 20 and c = 30; Now print the 
      sum of these three variables.


      
      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 7: Write a program to print the following output:

                       Ascii value of ‚ÄòA‚Äô is: __

                       Ascii value of ‚Äò@‚Äô is: __

                       In the blank space you should show the ascii code of the given characters.


      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 8: Take four double variables x, y, z and avg. Assign values to x, y and z as you want. Now calculate the average 
      of x, y and z and assign it to avg. Finally print the average value like-

                              Average of x, y and z is: ‚Äî‚Äì .


      
      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 9: Print ‚ÄúBangladesh‚Äù without quotation sign by using ascii values.

         [Use the given ascii values- B=66, a=97, n=110, g=103, l=108, a=97, d=100, e=101, s=115, h=104.]


      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 10: Rahul got 65.00 on physics, 83.50 on mathematics, 85.75 on C programming and 67.50 on English. Now write a program
       to calculate the average of his marks on 4 subjects and print it up to 2 digit after the decimal point. 
       [The result should look like: XX.XX]


      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 11: You are given the radius of a circle, r = 5.5. We know that, pi=3.1416. Now write a program to calculate the area 
      of the given circle and print it up to 2 digit after the decimal point. [The result should look like: XX.XX]


      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 12: Take two integer variables i = 0 and j = 0. Now write the output of the following program without running the code.

                                       int main()
                                       int i = 0;
                                       int j = 0;
                                       j = i++ + ++i;
                                       printf(‚Äú%d %d‚Äù,i,j);
                                       }
