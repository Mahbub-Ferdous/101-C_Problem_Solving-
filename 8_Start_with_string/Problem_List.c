📌️📌️CHAPTER:- 8. START OF STRINGS:------




       
       
       
       
       
       
       Problem 64: Write a program to print the following output-

                              Enter your name:

                              Mr. Jhon Snow [This line will be given by the user]

                              Hello!! Mr. Jhon Snow


      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 65: Take a word from user and print the word in reverse order. [If user gives “BANGLADESH”, your program should print
       “HSEDALGNAB”]


      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 66: Find the length of a given string.[If user gives input “LovE”, you should print: 4]


      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 67: Take a string as input from the user and print the every single character of it into a separate line. If user gives
       “DHAKA”, output should look like the following-

                             D

                             H

                             A

                             K

                             A


      
      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 68: Take three different string as input from the user(“We”, “ Love” and “ Bangladesh”). Now concate these three string and
       print it (“We Love Bangladesh”). [There is a leading space in “ Love” and “ Bangladesh”]


      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 69: Write a program which takes a string of alphabet as input and replace all the characters with the 3rd immediate
       character of it. All the alphabets of the input string will be small letter. [If user gives input “abc” you should print “def”, if
        user gives input “xyz” you should print “abc”]


      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 70: You are given a string mixed with uppercase and lowercase letters . Your task is to write a program which will flip the
       letters (UpperCase -> LowerCase, LowerCase -> UpperCase).

                   Example: INPUT: OUTPUT:

                   eLepHanT Elephant

                   cAt Cat

                   SuNDAY Sunday


      
      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 71: Write a program which will take a sentence as input and tell us how many words are there. [If user gives input “I love
       Bangladesh”, then the output should be: 3]


      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 72: A string is palindrome if it seems same from the both side. Like “ABA”, “XXYXX”, “M” all are palindromes and “XY” is
       not a palindrome. Now write a program which will take a string as input from the user and print “YES, It is a palindrome” if it
        satisfies the condition otherwise print “No, It is not a palindrome”.


      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      Problem 73: Let’s take a string and you have to find how many alphabets are there and their repetitions. Case sensitive.

                     Ex: Input: Output:

                     AaaBBc A(1)B(2)a(2)c(1)
